# Scheduling Budget Notifications

## Description
This guide explains how to schedule regular budget checks and send notifications to users if their budget status is approaching or exceeded.

## Implementation

### Setup
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `node-cron` for scheduling tasks.

### Code

```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
const { sendNotification } = require('./notificationService'); // Implement your notification service
const { checkBudget } = require('../expense/controller/budgetController').checkBudget; // Assuming you have a module for budget checking

// Example scheduler to run every day at 8 AM
cron.schedule('0 8 * * *', async () => {
  try {
    const userIds = [/* Fetch user IDs from your database or specify */];
    for (const userId of userIds) {
      const budgets = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM budget WHERE user_id = $1', [userId]);
      for (const budget of budgets.rows) {
        try {
          const budgetStatus = await checkBudget(budget);
          if (budgetStatus.status === 'approaching' || budgetStatus.status === 'exceeded') {
            await sendNotification(userId, Budget for category ${budget.category_id} is ${budgetStatus.status}!);
          }
        } catch (err) {
          console.error('Error checking budget:', err);
        }
      }
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error fetching budgets for notifications:', err);
  }
});
```

### Explanation
- **Dependencies**: The script uses `node-cron` for scheduling tasks. Ensure you have it installed in your project.
- **Notification Service**: Implement a notification service in `notificationService.js` to handle sending notifications to users.
- **Budget Checking**: The `checkBudget` function, which calculates the budget status, is imported from your budget controller.

### Scheduling
The `cron.schedule` function is set to run every day at 8 AM. You can adjust the cron expression to fit your desired schedule.

### Handling Errors
The code includes error handling to log any issues that occur during the budget checking and notification process.

## Example Usage
To use this scheduler, ensure it's included and run within your server or a separate scheduling service. It will automatically check budgets and send notifications based on the specified schedule.
