# Overall Description

## Product Perspective
The categories management module is an integral part of the Expense Management System, interacting closely with modules such as expense and income management. It facilitates the categorization of financial transactions into predefined or user-defined categories, enhancing user control over expense and income tracking.

## Product Functions
- **Create Categories**: Users can create new categories, specifying names, descriptions, and whether they are income or expense categories.
- **Retrieve Categories**: Users can view a list of available categories, including both common categories visible to all users and user-specific categories.
- **Update Categories**: Users can modify existing category details, such as names and descriptions, for user-specific categories.
- **Delete Categories**: Users can delete user-specific categories, with common categories protected from deletion to maintain system integrity.
- **Manage Visibility**: Users can control the visibility of user-specific categories, toggling them between hidden and visible states.

## User Characteristics
The primary users of the categories management module are individuals and businesses managing their financial transactions. Users are expected to have basic familiarity with financial management practices and the categorization of expenses and incomes.

## Constraints
- **Concurrent Access**: The system must efficiently handle concurrent requests from multiple users without compromising performance or data integrity.
- **Data Security**: The system must ensure the security and confidentiality of user data, particularly financial information stored within categories.
- **Scalability**: As the number of users and transactions grows, the system should scale seamlessly to accommodate increased demand and data volume.

## Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Users are assumed to be authenticated and authorized to access the system through the authentication module.
- **Database Connectivity**: The system relies on a robust and accessible database to store and retrieve category information.
